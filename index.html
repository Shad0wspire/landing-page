				<h2>U.S. Army Drone Engineer Intern</h2>
				<p> I contributed to and researched the process of building a mono-copter and quadcopter with thrust vectoring. Additionally, I installed and configured ArduPilot autopilot software and integrated Orange Cube (ADS-B) flight controllers, enhancing drone navigation and safety capabilities for test flight missions. To maximize efficiency, I utilized AutoDesk Inventor and AutoCAD to assist with dimensional modeling for advanced UAV systems and developed adjustment protocols and software to ensure ArduPilot could run smoothly. During this process, I recorded trials of test drones with varying thrust speeds to observe how different weather conditions could alter flight routes and how the adjustment protocols could self-correct the flight path.</p>

				<h2>Research Intern</h2>
				<p> I currently help conduct research to restructure computational notebooks to maximize cell reference output reproducibility and robustness. I mainly work with JupyterLab and Anywidget to create 
					more dynamic outputs through data visualization and trajectory analysis within notebook cells, and also currently working to expand to JSON structures. In the future, I will conduct research 
					regarding Machine Learning and their application to address Autonomous Driving and the problem of safety assurance in AI-based components.</p>

					foster bird conservation and sustainability awareness. I oversee all financial operations, including budgeting, financial planning, reporting, and audit preparation. This role involves managing donations
					and grants, ensuring compliance with financial regulations, and supporting fundraising efforts. Specifically, I heavily collaborate with other Directors to create our online store, as well as 
					helped to design merchandise. In addition to this, I partnered with the Director of Engineering to develop innovative avian technologies, such as GPS tracking systems, automated bird feeders, 
					drone-assisted habitat monitoring, and AI-driven bird call analysis.</p>

				<h2>Clubs</h2>
				<p>As the Director of Mathematics for Peer Tutors, I work with tutors who have completed core mathematical courses to enhance tutees' problem-solving skills while fostering social connections to 
					improve collaborative efforts. I conduct weekly board meetings, host training sessions on Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and content-specific areas, and manage scheduling conflicts over email. 
					I also interview and select applicants for sub-committees, leading these groups alongside other executive board members. Using Python and JavaScript, I create scripts for attendance checks and 
					performance measurement in Excel spreadsheets. Additionally, as the Director of Outreach for Youth for Key Club International, I established the Builder's Club through outreach with the District 
					Administration and organized service-based volunteering events. I collaborated with middle school administration to manage logistics and developed a self-updating service opportunities project for 
					junior high students using Python.</p>

				<h2>Public Health Intern</h2>
				<p> I partnered with community leaders from across the globe to design solutions for real-world problems facing communities in Africa. Specifically, I developed public health awareness in Nigerian 
					villages through online hygiene workshops and created logistical plans to hydrate these rural areas in a better way.</p>

				<h2>Software Engineering AI Fellow</h2>
				<p> I was part of the 31% selected where I built 5+ AI apps and APIs using NextJS, React.js, OpenAI, Pinecone, StripeAPI, Python, Django and Java with 98% accuracy as seen by 1000+ users. Particularly, 
					I was tasked with developing projects from design to deployment while leading 3+ engineering fellows using MVC design patterns. While being coached by Google, Apple, and Amazon engineers on 
					Agile, CI/CD, Git and microservice patterns, I also collaborated on various front/backend projects involving AI.</p>

				<h2>Peer to Peer Tech Intern</h2>
				<p>- I collaborated closely with my 11 fellow interns and the CEO to deliver quality resources to equip high schoolers in partner schools in Africa with high quality digital literacy daily 
					via developing comprehensive lessons with my team. We partnered with Code2Connect, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that has over 3000+ members across 5 countries and 3 continents, to promote 
					computer literacy for all and ensure that every student has a complete digital literacy education. I helped create a tech literacy curriculum to help students there learn more about revolutionary 
					technologies of the future. I taught Python, Java, as well as other frameworks as part of C2C to multiple students in batches last year to help them adjust to their Computer Science curriculum.
					While adapting presentations to the students by deducing possible shortcomings of the students' understanding to implement edits to the curriculum so students improve their digital literacy 
					effectively, I also taught large classes of students in school over online video conferences with the use of these presentations. Additionaly, I worked with the Outreach, Social Media and Device 
					Prep teams to reach other organizations online worldwide and around the Chicago area to gather teachers and technological resources to teach more students.</p>

				<h2>RSM Administration Assistant</h2>
				<p> As the Administration Assistant, I aided in the management of the school website by graphically designing new infographics based on student performance and the school's reputation. I also 
					graphically designed recruitment infographics to send to parents via email. Additionally, I helped troubleshoot computer errors and organized files/information in Google Sheets using formulas and 
					functions. While supporting teachers and staff by preparing classroom materials, I handled logistics for events, and coordinated communications. Assisting in the management of the school website

				<h2>RSM Homework Help Math Tutor</h2>
				<p> As the Homework Help Math Tutor, I helped 5+ tutees a day from K-12 with difficult concepts by creating new and enticing strategies to best tackle their doubts. While I provided one-on-one and 
					group tutoring sessions to students from K-12, focusing on a range of mathematical concepts, I developed personalized lesson plans and homework assignments to meet each student's unique needs and 
					learning pace. I additionally monitored and assessed student progress, providing feedback and additional support as needed. </p>
